# Netflix Clone
Creating a Netflix clone using HTML and CSS involves replicating the user interface and styling elements to mirror the original platform's look and feel. HTML provides the structure, defining sections like header, navigation, and content areas. CSS is crucial for styling, from fonts and colors to layout and responsiveness. Utilizing CSS flexbox or grid can aid in organizing content. Incorporating media queries ensures the design adjusts gracefully across different devices. JavaScript may enhance interactivity, like dropdown menus or modal dialogs. Emphasizing clean code and attention to detail is vital for an authentic user experience, capturing the essence of Netflix's interface.
